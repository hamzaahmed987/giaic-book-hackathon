# Chapter 4 Summary

## RAG Pipeline

```
Documents → Chunk → Embed → Store in Vector DB
Query → Embed → Search → Retrieve → Generate with Context
```

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Chunk Size | 200-1000 tokens | 500 for general use |
| Overlap | 10-20% | 50-100 tokens |
| Top-K | 3-10 | 5 is good default |
| Embedding Model | OpenAI, Cohere | text-embedding-3-small |

## Best Practices

1. Include metadata for filtering and citations
2. Use semantic chunking when possible
3. Consider hybrid search for better recall
4. Add reranking for precision
5. Always validate with real queries
