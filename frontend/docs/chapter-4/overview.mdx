# Chapter 4: RAG Systems

<ChapterActions chapterId="chapter-4" />

## Learning Objectives

:::info Objectives
1. **Understand** how RAG systems combine retrieval with generation
2. **Implement** vector embeddings and semantic search
3. **Build** a complete RAG pipeline with Qdrant
4. **Optimize** retrieval quality and response accuracy
:::

## Why RAG?

LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and can hallucinate. RAG solves this by:
- Grounding responses in your actual data
- Providing up-to-date information
- Adding citations and references

    B --> C[Vector Search]
    C --> D[Retrieve Docs]
    D --> E[LLM + Context]
    E --> F[Grounded Response]
```
