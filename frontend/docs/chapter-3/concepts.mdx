# Core Concepts of Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of designing inputs to AI models to get desired outputs. It's both an art and a science.

## Key Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

```
❌ Bad: "Write something about AI"
✅ Good: "Write a 200-word explanation of how neural networks learn, suitable for high school students"
```

### 2. Provide Context

```
✅ Good: "You are an expert Python developer reviewing code for security vulnerabilities. Analyze this code and identify any security issues..."
```

### 3. Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

```
Convert the following to formal English:

Input: "gonna grab some coffee"
Output: "I am going to get some coffee"

Input: "wanna come with?"
Output: "Would you like to accompany me?"

Input: "that's so cool!"
Output: [Model completes based on pattern]
```

## Advanced Techniques

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cot" label="Chain of Thought" default>

**Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompts the model to show its reasoning:

```
Solve this step by step:
What is 23 × 17?

Step 1: Break down 17 into 10 + 7
Step 2: Calculate 23 × 10 = 230
Step 3: Calculate 23 × 7 = 161
Step 4: Add: 230 + 161 = 391

Answer: 391
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="roles" label="Role Playing">

Assign specific personas:

```
You are a senior software architect with 20 years of experience.
Review this system design and provide feedback focusing on:
- Scalability concerns
- Potential bottlenecks
- Security considerations
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="format" label="Output Formatting">

Specify exact output formats:

```
Analyze this text and return JSON with exactly this structure:
{
  "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "key_topics": ["topic1", "topic2"]
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The CRAFT Framework

| Letter | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **C** | Context | "You are a data scientist..." |
| **R** | Role | "...helping a junior developer..." |
| **A** | Action | "...review this code..." |
| **F** | Format | "...provide feedback as bullet points..." |
| **T** | Tone | "...in a constructive and encouraging manner." |

## Common Patterns

### System Prompt Pattern
```
SYSTEM: You are [role]. Your task is to [action].
Always [constraint 1]. Never [constraint 2].
Format responses as [format].

USER: [specific request]
```

### Template Pattern
```
Given the following [input type]:
---
{input}
---

Perform [task] and return [output format].
Consider [special instructions].
```
