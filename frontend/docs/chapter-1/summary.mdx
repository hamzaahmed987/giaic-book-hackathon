# Chapter 1 Summary

## Key Concepts Recap

### What is AI?

```
AI = Creating systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence
```

**Core capabilities**: Learning, Reasoning, Problem Solving, Perception, Language Understanding

### The AI Hierarchy

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Artificial Intelligence      │ ← Broadest concept
│  ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │      Machine Learning        │ │ ← Learning from data
│  │  ┌────────────────────────┐  │ │
│  │  │     Deep Learning      │  │ │ ← Neural networks
│  │  └────────────────────────┘  │ │
│  └──────────────────────────────┘ │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Types of AI

| Type | Status | Capability |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Narrow AI** | ✅ Exists today | Specialized for one task |
| **General AI** | ❌ Theoretical | Human-level across all domains |
| **Superintelligent AI** | ❌ Hypothetical | Exceeds all human intelligence |

### AI System Components

1. **Data** → The fuel
2. **Model/Algorithm** → The brain
3. **Training** → The learning process
4. **Inference** → Using the trained model

## Key Formulas

**Neuron Output**:
```
output = activation(Σ(inputs × weights) + bias)
```

**Common Activation (Sigmoid)**:
```
σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```

## Quick Reference Code

```python
# Basic ML Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# 1. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# 2. Train model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Calling chatbots "AGI" | Current AI is narrow, not general | Recognize limitations of narrow AI |
| Ignoring data quality | Poor data → poor results | Invest in data cleaning |
| Overfitting to training data | Model memorizes, doesn't generalize | Use train/test splits, validation |
| Expecting AI to "understand" | AI finds patterns, doesn't truly understand | Design for pattern matching |

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AI** | Artificial Intelligence - machines mimicking human intelligence |
| **ML** | Machine Learning - learning from data without explicit programming |
| **DL** | Deep Learning - ML using multi-layer neural networks |
| **Training** | Process of learning patterns from data |
| **Inference** | Using a trained model to make predictions |
| **Features** | Input variables used to make predictions |
| **Labels** | Target/output variables (in supervised learning) |
| **Overfitting** | Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data |
| **Epoch** | One complete pass through the training dataset |
